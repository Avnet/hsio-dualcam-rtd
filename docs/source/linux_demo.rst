Running the PetaLinux OS Image
==============================

After the SDcard has been properly imaged, insert the card into your ZUBoard 1CG. Optionally you may also wish to connect a USB keyboard and a 1080p video monitor.

#. Set the J3 jumper on the ZUBoard to 1.2V I/O.  This is required for the MIPI interface for the cameras.

#. Press the power switch (SW7) to turn on the board.  Once the board boots you will be prompted for login credentials.
    * Login: root (no password required)

#. Open a UART console connection to the ZUBoard 1CG
    * Baud 115200
    * 8 bits
    * No parity
    * 1 stop bit

#. In the UART console for the ZUBoard 1CG, determine the assigned IP address of the ZUBoard.

.. code-block:: console

    # ifconfig eth0

#. Launch a ssh session to the ZUBoard 1CG.

    * On a Windows host PC the MobaXterm  X11 terminal software is needed to run a ssh session.  Download MobaXterm for your host at `<https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`_ and install it, then launch MobaXterm and start a new ssh session with the IP address of the ZUBoard 1CG and make sure X11-Forwarding is enabled.

    * On a Linux host PC the ssh session can be launched from the command line.

.. code-block:: console

    # ssh root@<IP address>

.. image:: images/linux_ssh.jpg

#. At the command prompt change to the **avnet_dualcam_python_examples** folder and launch the Python example.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~/avnet_dualcam_python_examples
    $ python3 ./avnet_dualcam_passthrough.py

.. image:: images/dualcam_passthrough.jpg
    :align: center

#. Press <ctrl>-c to close the demo window.  There is also a Python anaglyph application example that can be run.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 ./avnet_dualcam_anaglyph.py

.. image:: images/dualcam_anaglyph.jpg
    :align: center

#. Press <ctrl>-c to close the demo window.
